# Rogue Runs (Fast + Slow): Consolidated Fix Plan

This document merges rogue-fast and rogue-slow findings.
It intentionally separates:
- spec-backed fixes (already defined by current specs);
- runtime-contract fixes (implemented behavior not fully specified);
- required spec deltas (new contracts that must be documented).

## Spec Coverage Map

- **Spec-backed now**
- Canonical stage status path for routing: `{logs_root}/{node_id}/status.json`.
- DOT routing/conditions/retry semantics.
- Parallel branch isolation + join/error policy model.
- Provider/model explicitness principles from unified-llm and attractor model selection.
- **Runtime-contract in code but under-specified**
- Stall watchdog liveness aggregation.
- Attempt lifecycle identifiers and heartbeat validity windows.
- Terminal run artifact (`final.json`) behavior.
- Legacy status fallback probes from worktree locations.
- Failure classification/signature metadata.
- **Spec deltas required**
- Run-level cancellation precedence across parallel/subgraph flows.
- Traversal-level deterministic cycle-break behavior.
- Strict pin/no-failover run-config semantics.
- Canonical outcome casing rule across attractor docs.
- Runtime event taxonomy contract for progress/liveness.

## Core Invariants (Formal)

- Parent liveness invariant: if any active branch emits accepted liveness events, parent watchdog idle timer resets.
- Attempt ownership invariant: an attempt may consume status only from the same `(run_id, node_id, attempt_id)` scope.
- Heartbeat lifecycle invariant: no heartbeat for an attempt after its attempt-end marker.
- Cancellation invariant: once run-level cancel is observed, no new stage attempts start; traversal exits before selecting another edge.
- Failure-causality invariant: raw `failure_reason` survives check/conditional routing and terminal output.
- Terminal artifact invariant: all controllable terminal paths persist top-level terminal outcome artifact(s).

## Runtime Data Model Definitions (Must Be Explicit Before Coding)

- `run_generation`: monotonic integer incremented on each loop-restart generation of a run; included on liveness events to avoid stale-branch attribution.
- `attempt_id`: deterministic identifier for a stage attempt, format `branch_id:node_id:attempt_ordinal`, where `attempt_ordinal` is 1-indexed to match attractor retry semantics.
- `terminal_artifact`: top-level `final.json` at run logs root, schema aligned with `internal/attractor/runtime/final.go`:
  - `timestamp`
  - `status` (`success|fail`)
  - `run_id`
  - `final_git_commit_sha`
  - `failure_reason` (optional)
  - `cxdb_context_id`
  - `cxdb_head_turn_id`
- Terminal status mapping (run-level, intentionally binary):
  - run `success` only when pipeline reaches terminal success state with goal-gate constraints satisfied
  - run `fail` for terminal failures (including exhausted retries, watchdog/cancel/internal fatal paths, or unsatisfied goal-gate completion)
- `cycle_break_threshold`: sourced from runtime graph attribute `loop_restart_signature_limit` (implemented in engine today, not in attractor-spec), default `3` when unset/invalid.
  - This graph attribute is runtime-contract behavior today and must be documented as a spec delta.

## Event Taxonomy Mapping (Bridge, Not Replacement)

Attractor runtime events below are implementation telemetry and must be mapped to spec-level semantics:

- Attractor spec `StageStarted` maps to runtime `stage_attempt_start` (one per attempt, including retries).
- Attractor spec `StageCompleted` maps to runtime `stage_attempt_end` with success status.
- Attractor spec `StageFailed`/`StageRetrying` maps to runtime `stage_attempt_end` fail/retry plus retry scheduling events.
- Mapping cardinality: spec stage events are stage-level; runtime attempt events are attempt-level (one-to-many under retries).
- Coding-agent-loop events (`TOOL_CALL_START`, `TOOL_CALL_END`, assistant text events) map to attractor liveness/progress events in API backend.
- Runtime-only events (`stage_heartbeat`, `deterministic_failure_cycle_*`, ingestion decision events) are operational events and require spec-delta documentation.

Accepted liveness event set for watchdog:
- `stage_attempt_start`
- `stage_attempt_end`
- `stage_heartbeat`
- `branch_complete`
- `api_tool_call_start`
- `api_tool_call_end`
- `api_assistant_text_delta`

## Spec Alignment Guardrails

- Keep `{logs_root}/{node_id}/status.json` authoritative for routing.
- Do not change DOT condition semantics or retry/fallback routing behavior.
- Preserve join policy semantics (`wait_all`, `k_of_n`, `first_success`, `quorum`) and error policy semantics (`fail_fast`, `continue`, `ignore`) while run is live.
- Run-level cancellation precedence rule (runtime policy pending spec delta): cancellation always stops further work regardless of branch `error_policy`; `error_policy` only governs branch-local failure handling before cancellation.
- Resolve attractor status-case inconsistency explicitly: Section 5.2 enum style vs Section 10.3 lowercase outcomes.
  - Engine behavior: status-file parsing can be tolerant for legacy input casing, but DOT condition matching remains spec-defined case-sensitive until/if specs change.
  - Migration note: legacy uppercase DOT conditions must be rewritten to lowercase via lint/fix tooling before enabling any casing-canonicalization change to condition evaluation.
  - Spec delta: codify lowercase as canonical wire/storage form.

## P0 (Immediate)

- Harden status ingestion first (precondition for reliable liveness/routing).
  - Precedence:
  - canonical `{logs_root}/{node_id}/status.json`
  - fallback `{worktree}/status.json` (legacy compatibility)
  - fallback `{worktree}/.ai/status.json` (legacy compatibility)
  - Rules:
  - fallback accepted only when canonical missing
  - ownership check must pass when ownership fields are present
  - canonical file is never overwritten by lower-precedence source
  - accepted fallback is atomically copied to canonical path with provenance metadata
  - canonical status writes must be temp-file + atomic rename to avoid partial-read races
  - Done when: deterministic source selection is observable in logs/events.
- Make watchdog liveness fanout-aware.
  - Done when: no false `stall_watchdog_timeout` while any active branch emits accepted liveness events.
  - Coverage must include join policies: `wait_all`, `k_of_n`, `first_success`, `quorum`.
- Stop heartbeat leaks with attempt scoping.
  - Done when: zero `stage_heartbeat` after matching attempt-end for identical `(node_id, attempt_id, run_generation)`.
- Add cancellation guards in subgraph/parallel traversal.
  - Done when: after run cancel, no new attempts start and traversal exits without selecting another edge.
  - Clarification: `error_policy=ignore` never suppresses run-level cancellation.
- Extend deterministic cycle-break handling to subgraph path.
  - Done when: deterministic signature repetition triggers breaker using configured `loop_restart_signature_limit`.
- Preserve failure causality through routing.
  - Done when: terminal outputs retain upstream raw reason; normalized signature is separate metadata.
- Guarantee terminal artifact persistence for all controllable terminal paths.
  - Done when: `final.json` is persisted on success/fail/cancel/watchdog/internal fatal paths (best effort excludes uncatchable `SIGKILL`).

## P1 (Hardening)

- Align engine failure classification with unified-llm taxonomy.
  - Required mapping coverage:
  - `AuthenticationError`
  - `AccessDeniedError`
  - `NotFoundError`
  - `InvalidRequestError`
  - `RateLimitError`
  - `ServerError`
  - `ContentFilterError`
  - `ContextLengthError`
  - `QuotaExceededError`
  - `RequestTimeoutError`
  - `AbortError`
  - `NetworkError`
  - `StreamError`
  - `ConfigurationError`
  - Done when: terminal classing distinguishes cancel/stall/runtime faults from provider deterministic/transient categories using full mapping.
  - Existing behavior baseline to preserve: `ContentFilterError` remains deterministic unless an explicit policy override says otherwise.
- Normalize failure signatures only for breaker decisions.
  - Done when: raw reason remains route-visible; normalized key used only by breaker/telemetry.
- Enforce pinned model/provider no-failover policy from run config.
  - Done when: policy violations fail loudly; engine never silently falls back when config forbids it.
- Tighten provider tool adaptation (`apply_patch` and API/CLI contract differences).
  - Done when: contract violations are deterministic and diagnosable.
- Add parent rollup branch telemetry.
  - Done when: parent stream shows branch health summaries without per-branch log spelunking.

## P2 (Tests: Unit + Integration + E2E)

- Watchdog fanout liveness.
  - Unit: liveness aggregator accepts branch events and resets idle timer.
  - Integration: no false timeout with active branch signals.
  - Matrix: join policies (`wait_all`, `k_of_n`, `first_success`, `quorum`) and error policies (`fail_fast`, `continue`, `ignore`).
- Heartbeat lifecycle.
  - Unit: heartbeat emitter stops on attempt completion signal.
  - Integration: no post-attempt heartbeats in progress stream.
- Cancellation.
  - Unit: cancel gate prevents scheduling next stage.
  - Integration: no new attempts after cancel; traversal exits cleanly.
  - Matrix: includes `error_policy=ignore` to prove cancellation precedence.
- Deterministic cycle breaker.
  - Unit: signature counting/limit logic.
  - Integration: subgraph breaker triggers at configured limit.
- Status ingestion.
  - Unit: precedence + ownership decision table.
  - Decision table minimum cases:
  - canonical present + valid -> choose canonical
  - canonical missing + worktree status valid/owned -> choose worktree status
  - canonical missing + worktree invalid + .ai valid/owned -> choose .ai status
  - canonical missing + fallback ownership mismatch -> reject fallback
  - canonical present + fallback present -> canonical wins
  - fallback accepted -> atomic canonical copy with provenance recorded
  - Integration: canonical/fallback behavior with actual files.
  - Assertions: selected source path, ownership verdict, canonical write behavior (temp+rename), and provenance metadata are all observable.
- Failure propagation.
  - Unit: check/conditional passes through raw reason/class metadata.
  - Integration: terminal artifact preserves causal reason.
- Terminal artifact persistence.
  - Integration/E2E: `final.json` exists with expected fields across controllable terminal paths.
- No-failover policy.
  - Unit: policy evaluator.
  - Integration: pinned no-failover config never switches provider/model.
- True-positive watchdog.
  - Unit: no-event path triggers timeout logic.
  - Integration: timeout still fires when top-level and branch liveness are absent.
  - E2E: detached run with intentionally silent branches times out within configured watchdog bounds.

## Required Observability

- Branch-to-parent liveness counters/events with `run_generation`.
- Attempt lifecycle events with `attempt_id`.
- Status ingestion decision events: searched paths, chosen source, parse result, ownership result, copy result.
- Cancellation exit events: node, reason, and exit point.
- Cycle-break events: signature, count, limit.
- Terminalization events: final status and artifact path.

## Spec Delta Backlog (Document in Specs)

- Runtime event taxonomy for attractor progress/liveness events and mapping to existing spec events.
- Watchdog semantics: accepted liveness set, aggregation rules, and stall decision contract.
- Attempt lifecycle semantics: attempt identity, ownership, and heartbeat validity.
- Cancellation semantics across parallel join/error policies.
- Traversal-level deterministic cycle-break contract.
- Terminal artifact (`final.json`) contract and required schema.
- Legacy fallback status contract (`worktree/status.json`, `.ai/status.json`) + deprecation plan.
- Explicit pinned-model failover policy contract.
- Canonical outcome casing contract.

## Implementation Order (Risk-Aware)

- Stage 1: status ingestion hardening + ownership checks.
- Stage 2: draft spec deltas for status/casing/cancel/watchdog/event contracts (before broad behavior rollout).
- Stage 3: watchdog fanout aggregation + heartbeat lifecycle fixes.
- Stage 4: cancellation guards + subgraph cycle-break parity.
- Stage 5: failure taxonomy mapping + no-failover policy enforcement.
- Stage 6: full test matrix and release gates.
- Stage 7: finalize and merge spec-delta docs to remove implementation/spec drift.
