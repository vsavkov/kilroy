Port the classic Rogue 5.4.4 game from C to Rust compiled to WebAssembly, playable in a browser. The original C source is at demo/rogue/original-rogue/ — about 16,800 lines across 33 files. The deliverable is a single HTML page at demo/rogue/rogue-wasm/www/index.html with classic ASCII terminal rendering: 80x24 grid, @ player, # corridors, monster letters A-Z, dark background, monospace font. This must be an exact mechanical port — same dungeon generation algorithms, same monster stats and AI, same item tables, same RNG formula, same combat math — a faithful 1:1 translation of every game system. ncurses I/O gets replaced by a WASM bridge to a JS terminal renderer, and save/load uses localStorage instead of the filesystem.
